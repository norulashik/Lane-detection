Lane Detection using OpenCV
This project focuses on developing a model for detecting lane lines on roads, a critical component for advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) and autonomous driving technologies. Using OpenCV and NumPy, the project implements edge detection, region of interest masking, and the Hough Line Transform to accurately identify and track lane lines. The code was developed and run using the Atom platform. The system is designed to be robust across diverse road conditions and is validated for potential real-world applications like lane-keeping assistance and autonomous navigation.
